            MGGSurvival has been up and running for over three years now!
            <br>
            <br>
            MGGSurvival has a great community with awesome, friendly Staff. At least one staff member is on most of the time. I, the Owner, never build in creative. I think its cheating.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want a server where you can just survive and thrive, without all the distracting plugins that can ruin the Survival experience, then come join MGGSurvival!
            <br>
            <br>
            We have an anti-cheat plugin as well as a rollback plugin, so if someone griefs your stuff, just tell a Staff member and they will find out whodunit, revert the grief, and ban the offender!
            <br>
            <br>
            The map was reset recently, so theres room for everyone!
            <br>
            <br>
            Come play survival with cool people! If you refer a new player to the server, you both get free diamonds! You also get free diamonds if you bring a friend! So join and hang out with some awesome Minecrafters!!
            <br>
