Search before
-------------

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull
requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Use sites such as
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) instead.
* Please, please, please, **SEARCH** before you file a new issue or request.

Guidelines
----------

Before using the issue tracker, we require you read the specific guidelines, depending on the topic:
a bug report, a feature request or a pull request.

### Bug Report

Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you! Good bug reports are also quite rare.  
To help and raise the bug report quality, **you _must_ read the wiki document about [Bug Reports](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/wiki/Bug-Report).**

### Feature Request

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits the scope and
goals of the project. Check also the [Roadmap](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/wiki/Road-Map),
maybe your idea is already planned.

It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible and get in touch. Feel free to detail how you envision
things, be they about (pseudo)code, interface, mockup, etc...

### Pull Request

Good pull requests are a fantastic help. But please get in touch before you start working,
it's always a sad moment to dismiss a patch for which a coder has spent a lot of time because
it simply does not fit the project. Please read the wiki
document about [Pull requests](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/wiki/Pull-Request).
