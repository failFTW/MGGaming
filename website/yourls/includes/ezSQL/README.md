# ezSQL - YOURLS implementation

* The original ezSQL files (`ez_sql_[core|mysql|mysqli|pdo].php`) are unmodified  to make updating easy when (if) the original classes are updated.
* The YOURLS modifications live in their own files (`ez_sql_*_yourls.php`).
* Each `ez_sql_stuff.php` must have a corresponding `ez_sql_stuff_yourls_php` file.
