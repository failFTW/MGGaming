            MGGSurvival has a great community with awesome, friendly Staff. At least one staff member is on most of the time. I, the Owner, never build in creative. I think its cheating. <br><br>

If you want a server where you can just survive and thrive, without all the distracting plugins that can ruin the Survival experience, then come join MGGSurvival!<br><br>

We have an anti-cheat plugin as well as a rollback plugin, so if someone griefs your stuff, just tell a Staff member and they will find out whodunit, revert the grief, and ban the offender!<br><br>

The map was reset recently, so theres room for everyone! <br><br>

Come play survival with cool people! If you refer a new player to the server, you both get free diamonds! You also get free diamonds if you bring a friend! So join and hang out with some awesome Minecrafters!! <br><br>

Want to support the server, with barely any work on your part? Put our Banner in your forum signature or even on your own site! Code Below! <br><br>
